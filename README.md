####Analysis
Full Adder: I determined how the Full Adder should operate by creating a truth table with A, B, and Cin as inputs and Sum and Cout as outputs. From the truth table I determined by SOP equation for each of my outputs. I then created a schematic from my SOP. I created a [test bench](https://github.com/JasonPluger/ECE281_Lab2/blob/master/Full_Adder_testbench.vhd "test bench code") for my Full Adder and verified that the [waveform](https://github.com/JasonPluger/ECE281_Lab2/blob/master/full_adder.JPG "Full Adder Waveform)results matched my truth table, which they did.
